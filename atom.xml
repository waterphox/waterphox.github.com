    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hrmm, I should have posted a bunch more before this.
Since posting about Sugar Activities I have been trying to acquaint myself with python.
We&#8217;ve also made some headway on Sweetermail, which is what we&#8217;ve named our XOmail furthering project,
I haven&#8217;t been able to help much, due to lack of python experience; but with the python practise I can at least understand the source code now.
It seemed like learning python would not be such a daunting task, but now http://trypython.org is giving 503 errors. :/</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I perused the activities pages of the Sugar Labs site and picked a few activities I thought were interesting.
Physics, Jam GBA Emulator, and Kiwix.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Physics is interesting because it is somewhat like another game I enjoy immensely, Phun. There are less options than Phun, but the core &#8220;make objects that bounce around with physical properties&#8221; thing is still there.</p>

<p>As the XOs have little Gameboy-like buttons on them, I figured a GBA emulator would be perfect. I can&#8217;t wait to fold the screen down and try playing Rhythm Tengoku!</p>

<p>Lastly, Kiwix is an offline Wikipedia reader. I like the idea of that because the environments XOs are intended for may not always have an internet connection. After downloading pre-packaged pages to Kiwix, there will be lots of available reading on the XO. You know how it is with Wikipedia, a few clicks and you&#8217;re reading for hours.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='There was a guy that was a person'>
I often find myself among people. Lots of people. People that do things and go places.
When I am with these people, they are people. Like, seriously. Have you ever seen a person not be people?
Well, I have once. There was a guy that was a person, and that concerned me.
Maybe one day all things will be better, but until then, I&#8217;ll just have to cope knowing that various persons can be people, too.

I am going to test putting a code block in my pull quote. This is reeally advanced and should only be done by professionals.</p>

<p>That does not work. Don&#8217;t do this, for the love of glob.

<p>Putting things in stars makes it italic. Sweet! <em>dances</em></p>

<p>Mmk. That should do it.</p>
