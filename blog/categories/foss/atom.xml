    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I perused the activities pages of the Sugar Labs site and picked a few activities I thought were interesting.
Physics, Jam GBA Emulator, and Kiwix.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Physics is interesting because it is somewhat like another game I enjoy immensely, Phun. There are less options than Phun, but the core "make objects that bounce around with physical properties" thing is still there.</p>

<p>As the XOs have little Gameboy-like buttons on them, I figured a GBA emulator would be perfect. I can't wait to fold the screen down and try playing Rythm Tengoku!</p>

<p>Lastly, Kiwix is an offline Wikipedia reader. I like the idea of that because the environments XOs are intended for may not always have an internet connection. After downloading pre-packaged pages to Kiwix, there will be lots of available reading on the XO. You know how it is with Wikipedia, a few clicks and you're reading for hours.</p>
