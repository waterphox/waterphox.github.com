    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I perused the activities pages of the Sugar Labs site and picked a few activities I thought were interesting.
Physics, Jam GBA Emulator, and Kiwix.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Physics is interesting because it is somewhat like another game I enjoy immensely, Phun. There are less options than Phun, but the core &#8220;make objects that bounce around with physical properties&#8221; thing is still there.</p>

<p>As the XOs have little Gameboy-like buttons on them, I figured a GBA emulator would be perfect. I can&#8217;t wait to fold the screen down and try playing Rhythm Tengoku!</p>

<p>Lastly, Kiwix is an offline Wikipedia reader. I like the idea of that because the environments XOs are intended for may not always have an internet connection. After downloading pre-packaged pages to Kiwix, there will be lots of available reading on the XO. You know how it is with Wikipedia, a few clicks and you&#8217;re reading for hours.</p>
